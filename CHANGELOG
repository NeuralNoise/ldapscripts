2007/01/03 : ldapscripts 1.5
  - Fixed typos (thanks to Mikael Lammentausta)
  - Small fixes to the install script
  - ldapadduser : use $_UID instead of $_USER while chown'ing homedir (thanks to Mikael Lammentausta)
  - ldapadduser : new option to ask for the gecos (thanks to Mikael Lammentausta)
  - ldapadduser : new option to copy skeleton files to home directories (thanks to Mikael Lammentausta)
  - ldapadduser : now skip user's home dir creation if it already exists
  - ldapadduser/ldapaddmachine : modified account description attributes : set to 'User account' or 'Machine account'
  - ldapadduser/ldapaddgroup/ldapaddmachine : use $_USER and $_GROUP instead of $1 when possible
  - New _ldappasswd script to modify a user's password (suggested by Mikael Lammentausta)

2006/01/05 : ldapscripts 1.4
  - More code cleaning !!! Code now clean... (and bug-free ???) - thanks to Madcoder for the help he provided !
  - Removed dependency to slappasswd !!! Using ldappasswd instead (included in the standard ldap-client commands)
  - Added new ldaprenameuser command (uses ldapmodrdn included in the standard ldap-client commands)
      Add this to Samba 3.0.21's configuration file : rename user script = ldaprenameuser '%uold' '%unew'
      Warning : renaming an entry (user/group/machine) only involves renaming its RDN !
      This means may have to change manually the account's homedir (user) and modify each group to include the new 
      rdn (user/machine) as a memberuid.
  - Also added useful _ldaprenamegroup and _ldaprenamemachine scripts (not used by Samba)
  - A user/machine is now searched using its uid (no more use of its cn)
  - Full command now shown in logs
  - Modified README
  - New TODO file
  - Man pages (section 1 for each script, section 5 for a global "ldapscripts" manual)

2005/10/01 : ldapscripts 1.3
  Compatibility rework / code cleaning - the scripts now work on FreeBSD !
  - no more calls to "source", use . instead
  - now using "=" instead of "==" in test
  - now return 1 instead of -1 when an error occurs
  - added possibility to specify the getent command, so you can use pw instead (for FreeBSD)
  - added auto-guess for this command if left blank in conf file
  - splitted the horrible conf file into a real conf file and a "runtime" file
