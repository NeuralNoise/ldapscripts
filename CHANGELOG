2005/10/01 : ldapscripts 1.3
  Compatibility rework / code cleaning - the scripts now work on FreeBSD !
  - no more calls to "source", use . instead
  - now using "=" instead of "==" in test
  - now return 1 instead of -1 when an error occurs
  - added possibility to specify the getent command, so you can use pw instead (for FreeBSD)
  - added auto-guess for this command if left blank in conf file
  - splitted the horrible conf file into a real conf file and a "runtime" file
