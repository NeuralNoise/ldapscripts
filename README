Ldapscripts - README file
*************************

Description :
*************

These scripts are designed to be used within the Samba's smb.conf file 
(or manually) and allow to create POSIX entries for users, groups and 
machines in an LDAP directory. They are written in sh and need ldap 
client commands to work correctly (ldapadd, ldapdelete, ldapmodify,
ldapsearch).

They are designed to be used under GNU/Linux or FreeBSD (any other
UNIX-like should also work) and require several binaries that should 
come with your OS (uuencode, getent/pw, date, grep, sed, cut, expr...)

Latest version available on http://contribs.martymac.com

Installing and configuring the ldapscripts :
********************************************

To install the scripts, just edit the install file to 
set up the installation directories, then type in :
# ./install

All the scripts will be copied (by default) into /usr/local/bin and 
ldapscripts.conf will be copied into /etc/ldapscripts.

Once installed, edit /etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.conf to 
configure the ldapscripts.

Then, just type in - e.g. :
# ldapadduser foo foogroup

Configuring your OpenLDAP server :
**********************************

Be sure to include these schemas in your slapd.conf :

- core.schema
- cosine.schema (for the account objectClass)
- nis.schema (for the posixAccount objectClass)

Using ldapscripts with Samba :
******************************

To use ldapscripts with Samba (e.g. for an NT4 -> Samba migration), just
add the following to your smb.conf file :

# [...]
add machine script = /usr/local/bin/ldapaddmachine '%u' sambamachines
add user script = /usr/local/bin/ldapadduser '%u' sambausers
add group script = /usr/local/bin/ldapaddgroup '%g'
add user to group script = /usr/local/bin/ldapaddusertogroup '%u' '%g'
delete user script = /usr/local/bin/ldapdeleteuser '%u'
delete group script = /usr/local/bin/ldapdeletegroup '%g'
delete user from group script = /usr/local/bin/ldapdeleteuserfromgroup '%u' '%g'
set primary group script = /usr/local/bin/ldapsetprimarygroup '%u' '%g'
rename user script = /usr/local/bin/ldaprenameuser '%uold' '%unew'
# [...]

and make sure sambamachines and sambausers exist before attempting to 
do a "net rpc vampire"...

Also be sure to have your machine using the LDAP server as a posix accounts
source (e.g. nsswitch / nss_ldap on GNU/Linux) since the scripts uses
getent (or pw for FreeBSD) to fetch accounts information.

Scripts not used by Samba (begin with a "_") :

_ldapdeletemachine : not used within smb.conf (but may be useful anyway)
_ldapinit : initializes the LDAP tree with a minimal hierarchy
_lsldap : does a big query on the LDAP server
_ldaprenamemachine : renames a POSIX machine account in LDAP
_ldaprenamegroup : renames a POSIX group in LDAP

Scripts that can be used in Samba's configuration file (smb.conf) :

ldapaddgroup : adds a POSIX group to LDAP
ldapadduser : adds a POSIX user to LDAP
ldapdeletegroup : deletes a POSIX group from LDAP
ldapdeleteuserfromgroup : deletes a memberUid entry from a POSIX group
ldapsetprimarygroup : sets gidNumber of a POSIX user or machine account
ldapaddmachine : adds a POSIX machine (user$) to LDAP
ldapaddusertogroup : add a memberUid entry to a POSIX group
ldapdeleteuser : deletes a POSIX user from LDAP
ldaprenameuser : renames a POSIX user account in LDAP
