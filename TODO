TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Replace the install script by a clean Makefile file
- Add a 'dry-run' option to (only) display LDIF data
- Add an option to delete users' home directories
- Add a script to manipulate entries' attributes

- Add more options to the scripts (a better parsing will be necessary)
  - an option to modify the home dirs (LDAP + directory + rights) of a user when renaming it ?
  - an option to modify related groups (memberUid's) when renaming/deleting a user/machine ?
  - an option to block deleting a group if it is a user's primary group ?
